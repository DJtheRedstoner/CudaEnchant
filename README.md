# CudaEnchant
A version of [Earthcomputer's Enchantment Cracker](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/)
that takes advantage of [NIVIDA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for very fast seed cracking times.

## Todo
- Data input
- Cracking second enchantment seed and then player seed
- Cuda error checking
- Optimizations

## Building
If you don't know how, you shouldn't be building this.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [Hexicube](https://github.com/Hexicube/) for answering my questions and helping
me debug while I was making this.
